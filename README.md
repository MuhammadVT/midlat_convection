# Statistical Study of Nightside Quite Time Subauroral Ionospheric Convection

This repo includes core codes used for my research on statistical study of 
mid-latitude ionospheric convection. In this study we use two years (2011 and 2012) of 
line-of-sight plasma drift velocity measurements obtained from
the six mid-latitude SuperDARN radars in the U.S. continents. 
The radars are, from west to east, Christmas Valley West, Christmas Valley East (Oregon),
Fort Hays West, Fort Hays East (Kansas),
Blackstone, and Wallops Island (Virginia).

** NOTE ** : The data used for this research are not included in this repo
due to their large size.
